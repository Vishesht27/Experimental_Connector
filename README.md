# Experimental_Connector


Experimental Connector is a Streamlit-based project that allows users to compare data from two footballers. This project leverages Streamlit connectors to fetch and display footballer statistics, enabling enthusiasts, analysts, and fans to make data-driven comparisons between two players.

## Introduction
The Experimental Connector project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for comparing the statistics of two footballers. It is built using the Streamlit framework, which makes it easy to create interactive and data-driven web applications with minimal coding effort. This project particularly targets football (soccer) enthusiasts who want to delve into the statistical comparison of their favorite players.

## Installation

  ```

## Features
* User-Friendly Interface: The project offers a simple and intuitive user interface where users can input the names of two footballers they wish to compare.

* Data Retrieval: The project uses Streamlit connectors to retrieve data from a predefined data source or API. This data includes various statistics related to the selected footballers.

* Data Visualization: The retrieved data is presented in an organized and visually appealing format. Users can see a side-by-side comparison of various statistics, such as goals scored, assists, dribbles, and more.

* Dynamic Interaction: Users can dynamically switch between different statistics to compare and contrast the performance of the two footballers in real-time.

## Usage
* Run the Streamlit app:
  ```
  streamlit run app.py 
  ```
* The app will open in your default web browser
* Enter the names of the two footballers you want to compare in the provided input fields.
* Explore the presented statistics and dynamically switch between different metrics to compare the players' performance.
